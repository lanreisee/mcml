# A Case for ModelConnect Markup Language: Beyond the Model Card

## Abstract

As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) become increasingly integrated into critical systems, the demand for robust, standardized model documentation that goes beyond basic transparency is paramount. Model Cards have emerged as a valuable tool for providing high-level information about AI models, but they often lack the technical depth and machine-readability required for operationalization, governance, and seamless integration into diverse environments. This paper presents the case for ModelConnect Markup Language (MCML), a structured, extensible framework that extends the Model Card concept to address the evolving needs of the AI landscape. MCML enables comprehensive metadata capture, multi-protocol execution, and integration with AI governance frameworks, fostering transparent, interoperable, and actionable AI models across industries.

## 1. Introduction: The Limitations of Traditional Model Cards

Model Cards have gained traction as a means of documenting AI models, offering insights into their purpose, ethical considerations, and performance metrics. However, traditional Model Cards often fall short in several key areas:

* **Limited Technical Detail:** Model Cards typically provide high-level descriptions, lacking the specific technical information required for deployment, monitoring, and integration into operational workflows.
* **Static and Human-Centric:** Model Cards are often static documents, primarily designed for human consumption. They lack the machine-readability necessary for automation and interoperability with various systems.
* **Inconsistent Structure:** The absence of a standardized structure or schema can lead to inconsistencies in Model Card content, hindering comparisons and automated processing.
* **Inadequate Governance Support:** Model Cards may provide basic information about ethical considerations, but they often lack the comprehensive metadata needed for robust governance, compliance tracking, and bias mitigation.

## 2. MCML: A Foundation for Actionable AI

ModelConnect Markup Language (MCML) addresses these limitations by introducing a structured, machine-readable framework that extends the Model Card concept. MCML leverages a schema-based approach to capture comprehensive metadata, enabling:

* **Actionable Documentation:** MCML provides the technical specifications required for deploying, monitoring, and integrating AI models into existing systems. This includes details about inputs, outputs, dependencies, and execution environments.
* **Multi-Protocol Interoperability:** MCML supports various protocols (REST, DICOM, HL7, GCP) to ensure compatibility with diverse execution environments, including cloud platforms, on-premise systems, and specialized healthcare infrastructure.
* **Robust Governance and Compliance:** MCML integrates governance and compliance tracking, facilitating adherence to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, and promoting responsible AI development through bias detection and mitigation strategies.

## 3. MCML in Practice: Key Features and Benefits

### 3.1 Structured Model Representation

MCML employs a JSON or YAML structure to ensure machine-readability and extensibility. Key components of an MCML model definition include:

* **Model Identification:** Name, version, author, license, description, creation date, etc.
* **Intended Use and Scope:** Clearly defined purpose, target audience, and limitations of the model.
* **Data Specifications:** Precise details about input and output data types, formats, and real-world constraints.
* **Dependencies and Environment:** Comprehensive list of libraries, packages, and execution environments required for model operation.
* **Model Assets:** Links to training data sources, model weights, evaluation logs, and other relevant artifacts.
* **Governance and Compliance:** Information related to fairness assessments, bias mitigation strategies, and regulatory compliance status.
* **Execution Support:** Declaration of supported protocols and interfaces for model execution (REST API, DICOM, HL7, GCP services, etc.).

### 3.2 Schema and Validation

MCML utilizes a well-defined schema to ensure consistency and facilitate validation. This schema includes specific data types, validation rules, and constraints for each element in the model definition. Tools and libraries can leverage this schema to automatically validate MCML documents, ensuring compliance and interoperability.
